# PrimeWizard for Linux

PrimeWizard is a C++ program designed for Linux systems that allows you to determine whether a given odd number is prime or not. It provides a simple command-line interface to input a number and receive a verdict. Additionally, it displays a progress bar while performing the primality test.

## Usage

To use PrimeWizard on Linux, follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate executable file for Linux systems. Make sure you are in the `linuxVersion` branch of this repository to get the correct executable.

2. Open a terminal in the directory where the PrimeWizard executable file is located.

3. Run the program with the following command:
```bash
.\primewizard
```
4. Enter an odd number and press Enter to start the primality test.

5. Observe the progress bar indicating the progress of the primality test.

6. Receive a verdict on whether the entered number is prime or not.

## Requirements

PrimeWizard for Linux requires a Linux distribution and a terminal for execution. You do not need to compile the program as we provide a pre-built executable file in the `linuxVersion` branch.
